The distribution of the ecosystems is presented in a chord-like circular diagram. The rim of the diagram represents the total size of the ecosystem types (i.e. number of NMPFs in each ecosystem), with the numbers outside the rim indicating the size scale. The intersections of categories are represented by arcs drawn between them. The size of the arc is proportional to the importance of the flow. (b) 8×8 matrix. Each cell in the matrix presents the common NMPFs in a binary combination of two ecosystems (e.g. 17,442 NMPFs are common among Marine and Freshwater ecosystems). The diagonal of the matrix displays the ecosystem-specific NMPFs. Each ecosystem column is coloured using the same colour code as Fig. 2, with the brightness of each cell being proportional to the NMPF number (brighter colour = less NMPFs). Data are shown as circos plots (a,d), colour-coded matrices (b,e) and UpSet plots (c,f). Data are shown as circos plots (a,d), colour-coded matrices (b,e) and UpSet plots (c,f).

(a) Venn Diagram, displaying the intersections among the different taxonomy categories. (b) Network representation of the protein clusters and their taxonomic assignments. The taxa are represented by central, coloured nodes (hubs) whereas the grey peripheral nodes represent the protein clusters. (a) Locations for all ED samples in the study with available geo-location metadata (Longitude and Latitude). (b-f) Distribution of geographically-isolated NMPF clusters, based on a cut-off distance of 1, 10, 100, 500, and 1000 Km. In all cases, dots are coloured based on the ecosystem type (blue: marine, cyan: freshwater, brown: soil, purple: other environmental, green: plants, red: human, magenta: non-human mammals, salmon pink: other host-associated, grey: engineered). (g) UpSet plot showing the distribution of the geographically-isolated NMPF clusters, based on a cut-off distance of 1000 Km (as shown in panel f). Map panels were created using data from the Natural Earth dataset (www.naturalearthdata.com). Five example NMPFs (a-e) are shown. Annotation is performed using using structural information (left), gene co-occurrence analysis (middle), and ecosystem distribution (right). Each of the NMPFs has a high-quality 3D model with at least one remote structural homologue to SCOPe. The NMPFs’ 3D models, produced with AlphaFold, and the structures of the SCOPe domains are rendered in the same orientation and coloured based on their per-residue structure confidence (pLDDT for AlphaFold models and inverse B-factor for experimental structures). The gene neighbourhood of each NMPF is presented in the form of an association network; with nodes representing gene products (the NMPFs and their adjacent genes that encode Pfam domains) and edges representing co-occurrence in the same sequencing scaffold. Pfam domains are further grouped using their associated COG functional categories as annotation. Finally, the NMPFs’ associated ecosystems are presented in pie charts. Ecosystems with a <1% presence in the NMPFs are summed into the category “Other ecosystems”. Three example NMPFs (a-c) are shown. The produced AlphaFold 3D model (left), gene co-occurrence analysis (middle) and ecosystem distribution (right) are given. 3D models are coloured based on their per-residue structure confidence (pLDDT). The gene neighbourhood of each NMPF is presented in the form of an association network; with nodes representing gene products (the NMPFs and their adjacent genes that encode Pfam domains) and edges representing co-occurrence in the same sequencing scaffold.

Ecosystems with a <1% presence in the NMPFs are summed into the category “Other ecosystems”. Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Results, Supplementary Figs. 1–13 and Supplementary Tables 1–13. Top co-occurring Pfam domains for NMPF clusters. NMPF structural models and structural/functional assignments, based on searches with TMalign, MMalign and HHsearch against SCOPe and PDB. Potential novel structural folds. Sheet 1 displays the list of novel folds, including their statistics (number of effective sequences, TrRosetta and AlphaFold scores) and TMalign/MMalign comparison results to SCOPe and PDB. Sheet 2 shows the top five co-occurring Pfam domains of the NMPFs associated with these folds. Contribution of NMPFs in the annotation of metagenomes and example recruitment for future updates. Sheet 1 presents a full summary of all the IMG/M datasets used in this study. Each dataset’s genomic content is presented, including the numbers of previously annotated protein-coding genes (hits to Pfam or to isolate genomes); genes clustered to NMPFs in the present study and remaining unannotated genes. Sheet 2 contains a breakdown of the MCL clustering, displaying which genes were kept in NMPFs and which were removed. Sheets 3 and 4 present the same results, grouped for each ecosystem type. Sheets 5 and 6 present the results of an example NMPF enrichment by recruiting sequences from 360 metagenomic/metatranscriptomic samples per NMPF (sheet 5) and dataset (sheet 6). Ecosystem classification in the GOLD, EMPO and ENVO classification schemes. Sheet 1 displays the ecosystem assignments of each ED sample used in the analysis. Sheet 2 displays the top ecosystem assignment of each NMPF cluster in the three schemes. In cases in which an ED sample or NMPF has no assignment to ENVO or EMPO, it was marked as unclassified.
